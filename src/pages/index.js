        <h2>My Story</h2>
        <p>I am a driven creative who enjoys learning new skills and working in collaborative teams.
          I love being involved in the entire design process, from research, to sketching and wireframing,
  to prototyping in different fidelities. Currently I am a UX Designer/Researcher for Harvard University Information Technology, where my work helps improve university life and productivity.</p>
        <p>I became a designer after a few years of working as a Museum Educator and as an e-commerce Customer Support Representative. These experiences made me passionate about customer advocacy and technology in education. I began my design journey by teaching myself to design and code. Later I formalized my learning by pursuing a Digital Media Design Masters at Harvard University's Extension School.</p>
